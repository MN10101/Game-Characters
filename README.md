# Game Characters
This Java program, **GameCharacters**, showcases the use of interfaces and classes to model different game characters. The program defines a `Character` interface with a method `useAbility`, and three classes (`Warrior`, `Mage`, and `Archer`) that implement this interface.

## Features

- **Character Interface:**
- Declares the `useAbility` method that each character class must implement.

- **Character Classes:**
- **Warrior:**
- Implements the `Character` interface.
- Represents a character with a devastating melee attack.

- **Mage:**
- Implements the `Character` interface.
- Represents a character that can conjure a storm of ice and frost.

- **Archer:**
- Implements the `Character` interface.
- Represents a character with unmatched precision in archery.

- **Game Class:**
- Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the usage of character classes.
- Creates an array of characters and displays each character's ability.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
- Compile and run the `Game` class.
- The program will display the abilities of different game characters.

2. **View Character Abilities:**
- Observe the abilities printed to the console for each character.

## Code Explanation

- **Character Interface:**
- Declares a method `useAbility` to ensure each character class provides an ability description.

- **Character Classes:**
- Each class implements the `Character` interface and provides a unique `useAbility` implementation.

- **Game Class:**
- Creates an array of characters and iterates through them, displaying each character's ability.

## Example

```java
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code snippet for reference.
    }
}
